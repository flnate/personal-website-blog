## Intro

Hello, my name is Nathan, I am a Christian first who is currently a college student studying for IT management at Cedarville University (Put link to Cedarville there) I mainly wanted to make this website and start blogging as a way to showcase my knowledge and things I am learning to potential employers. But I don't want this blog to be all professional, I would like this also to be a place where I can just make content for things I find interesting or fun. That could mean reviews for video games board games and movies, tutorials about technology that I am probably not qualified to make, Christian wisdom I have learned (Though I don't think I am wise enough for that), or just anything else I find interesting. I hope that this process will help me become a better writer along the way for school. I hope to make a lot of tutorials about Linux and selfhosting stuff on a raspberry pi as those are some things in the technological world I find interesting
